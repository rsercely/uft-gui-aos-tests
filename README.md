# uft-gui-aos-tests
This repository is a container for UFT tests developed to implement User Stories in the DAB

## Currently there is one test, uft-gui-aos-order-purchase that:
- Logs in
- Shops and purchases - as many times as there are lines in the local sheet
- Logs out

Note that you will have to edit the Login action and enter your AOS credentials.

The test assumes that you have a browser open on an AOS home page. It can be the public AOS (http://advantageonlineshopping.com) Nimbus AOS, (http://nimbusserver.aos.com:8000/), or even one of the dev AOS sites.
